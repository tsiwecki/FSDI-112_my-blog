## FSDI 112: Introductory Django
## My Blog Assignment

## My assignment was to create a blog that allows multiple users to create, view, update and delete blog posts. Blog posts can be viewed in both a list view as well as single article view.

## An  additional non-administrator user should be able to do all these things (apart from the admin or super user).

## I was to submit my project via my GitHub link and my readme file in had to have a link to your deployed app (on Heroku).
